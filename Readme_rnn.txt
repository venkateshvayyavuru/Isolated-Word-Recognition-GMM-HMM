For bulding the RNN

I have taken corpus form the gutenburg free text book (text.txt)
I have used utf-8 characters as units for LM(language model)

I have done experimets with 100 epochs with different hidden cell dim (100,200,50)

Plot for three experiments there in the repository(20_seq_Epcochs_vs_LOSS.png)

In these experiments i have fixed length chunk to the network and noted output in the files.Files are in the repository.

#For changing the seq length it is taking too much time .. I am doing
